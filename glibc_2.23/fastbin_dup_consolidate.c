This document is mostly used to demonstrate malloc_consolidate and how it can be leveraged with a
double free to gain two pointers to the same large-sized chunk, which is usually difficult to do 
directly due to the previnuse check.

malloc_consolidate(https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4714) essentially
merges all fastbin chunks with their neighbors, puts them in the unsorted bin and merges them with top
if possible.

As of glibc version 2.35 it is called only in the following five places:
1. _int_malloc: A large sized chunk is being allocated (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L3965)
2. _int_malloc: No bins were found for a chunk and top is too small (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4394)
3. _int_free: If the chunk size is >= FASTBIN_CONSOLIDATION_THRESHOLD (65536) (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4674)
4. mtrim: Always (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L5041)
5. __libc_mallopt: Always (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L5463)

We will be targeting the first place, so we will need to allocate a chunk that does not belong in the 
small bin (since we are trying to get into the 'else' branch of this check: https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L3901). 
This means our chunk will need to be of size >= 0x400 (it is thus large-sized).
